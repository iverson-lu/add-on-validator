# Add-on Catalog Analyzer Design

## Overview
This application automates retrieval and analysis of the HP Thin Client add-on catalog.
Given the remote XML document, it downloads the latest version, parses the add-on
entries, and produces human-readable summary statistics. The design aims to keep the
core logic testable and deterministic while providing a simple command-line entry
point for manual use.

## Goals
- Download the catalog XML from a configurable URL and persist it locally.
- Parse the XML into strongly-typed Python objects.
- Generate analytics such as add-on counts, platform coverage, and latest versions per
  add-on description.
- Provide an executable module (`python -m addon_catalog`) that performs the end-to-end
  workflow and prints the analysis.
- Ensure behavior is covered by automated unit tests without relying on the network.

## Key Components

### `addon_catalog.fetch` Module
- **`fetch_catalog(url: str, destination: Path, *, timeout: float = 10.0) -> Path`**
  Downloads the XML from the supplied URL using `urllib.request.urlopen` and writes it
  to `destination`. The function creates parent directories as needed and returns the
  path to the downloaded file. Separating this logic makes it easy to mock network
  calls during tests.

### `addon_catalog.models` Module
- Defines dataclasses for the domain objects parsed from the XML:
  - `FileEntry` with `type`, `path`, and `size`.
  - `Addon` containing metadata such as version, description, platforms, OSes, and
    file entries.
- Includes helper constructors that translate XML elements into the dataclasses.

### `addon_catalog.parser` Module
- **`parse_catalog(xml_text: str) -> List[Addon]`**
  Parses the XML string, yielding a list of `Addon` objects. It handles missing values
  gracefully (e.g., empty elements) and normalizes whitespace.

### `addon_catalog.analysis` Module
- **`summarize_addons(addons: Iterable[Addon]) -> CatalogSummary`**
  Computes aggregate metrics:
  - Total number of add-ons.
  - Unique platform IDs and OS types.
  - Latest version per add-on description, based on available dates.
- Provides `CatalogSummary.to_dict()` for easy serialization and pretty-printing.

### Command-Line Interface
- Implemented in `addon_catalog.__main__`. It fetches the catalog (caching it under
  `.cache/addon_catalog.xml`), parses the contents, computes the summary, and prints
  a formatted report.

## Testing Strategy
- **Fetch tests** mock `urllib.request.urlopen` to ensure the downloader writes the
  expected bytes without performing real HTTP requests.
- **Parser tests** use representative XML snippets to validate dataclass creation and
  proper handling of empty tags.
- **Analysis tests** confirm that aggregation logic correctly identifies unique
  platforms/OSes and latest versions per description when multiple entries exist.

## Future Enhancements
- Support incremental updates by comparing the local cache timestamp with the remote
  `DateStamp` attribute.
- Extend the CLI to emit JSON or CSV reports suitable for automation workflows.
- Add validation routines to detect inconsistent metadata (e.g., missing checksum
  entries).
